# File-Compression-Project

### Project Overview
- This project is a file compression utility implemented in C++ using the Huffman coding algorithm.
- Huffman coding is a widely-used data compression technique that efficiently reduces the size of files while maintaining data integrity.

### Key Features
- **File Compression:** The project provides the ability to compress input files, significantly reducing their size.
- **File Decompression:** Compressed files can be decompressed to their original form.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** It includes a command-line interface for ease of use.

### Huffman Algorithm Implementation
- **Huffman Tree:** The program constructs a Huffman tree from the input data, which is essential for both compression and decompression.
- **Huffman Codes:** Huffman codes are generated for each character in the input, allowing efficient binary encoding of characters.

### File Handling
- **Input File:** The project accepts input files in various formats, such as text files, binary files, or any other data files.
- **Output Files:** Two distinct output files are generated:
  - Compressed Binary File: This file contains the compressed data in an encrypted format, with the Huffman tree information.
  - Decompressed Text File: After decompression, this file stores the original data from the input file.
